```
Help me create a web application in Python with Streamlit and supported packages such as pandas, psycopg2. The purpose of the web app is enabling can allow user to upload document such as .csv, .docx, .pdf and perform a chat. While uploaded document chunks, conversation history shall be saved to Postgres database, the response should include step by step code blocks

Building a Document Chat Web App with Streamlit and Postgres
This guide outlines the steps to create a web application using Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Psycopg2, and Postgres. The application will allow users to upload documents (CSV, DOCX, PDF) and engage in a chat, with both document chunks and conversation history saved to a Postgres database.

Note: Due to the complexity of handling various document formats, this guide will focus on CSV files. Adapting the code for DOCX and PDF will require additional libraries and processing steps.

1. Setting Up the Environment
1.1 Install Required Libraries
```
pip install streamlit pandas psycopg2-binary
```
1.2 Database Configuration

Set up a Postgres database and make note of the connection details (host, database name, user, password).

2. Building the Streamlit Application
2.1 Import Libraries and Initialize Connection
```
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import psycopg2
```
# Replace with your database credentials
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host="your_host",
    database="your_database",
    user="your_user",
    password="your_password"
)

2.2 Define Functions for Database Interaction
```
def save_document_chunk(chunk, document_id):
    # Insert chunk into database with document_id reference
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute(
        "INSERT INTO document_chunks (document_id, content) VALUES (%s, %s)",
        (document_id, chunk)
    )
    conn.commit()
    cur.close()

def save_chat_message(message, user_id, document_id):
    # Insert chat message into database with user_id and document_id reference
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute(
        "INSERT INTO chat_history (user_id, document_id, message) VALUES (%s, %s, %s)",
        (user_id, document_id, message)
    )
    conn.commit()
    cur.close()
```
2.3 Create the Streamlit Interface
```
st.title("Document Chat App")

# File uploader
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a CSV file", type="csv")

if uploaded_file is not None:
    # Read the CSV file in chunks
    df = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file, chunksize=1000)

    # Save each chunk and display progress
    for i, chunk in enumerate(df):
        save_document_chunk(chunk.to_json(), i)
        st.write(f"Processed chunk {i+1}")

    # Chat interface
    user_message = st.text_input("Your message")
    if user_message:
        save_chat_message(user_message, "user_id", 0)  # Replace with actual user_id
        # Implement your chat response logic here
        st.write(f"Response to: {user_message}")
```
2.4 Run the Application

streamlit run your_app.py

3. Implementing Chat Functionality
You'll need to implement the chat response logic within the if user_message: block. This can involve using large language models, information retrieval techniques, or other methods to generate relevant responses based on the uploaded document and conversation history.

4. Expanding Functionality
Document Format Support: Use libraries like python-docx and PyPDF2 to handle DOCX and PDF files.
User Authentication: Implement user login and registration to manage chat history and document access.
Advanced Chat Features: Incorporate features like sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and knowledge base integration for richer interactions.
5. Database Schema
Here's a basic schema for the Postgres database:

CREATE TABLE document_chunks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    document_id INT,
    content JSONB
);

CREATE TABLE chat_history (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT,
    document_id INT,
    message TEXT
);

This schema stores document chunks with their corresponding document ID and chat messages associated with users and documents.

Remember to adapt the code and schema to your specific requirements and chat implementation.

Conversation History:
